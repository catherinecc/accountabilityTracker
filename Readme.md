## Records in java
Why - no need of constructor,getter,setter
immutable

## Lombok
Hooks into javac to inject code at compile time. 

## Maven
BOM / <dependencyManagement> lets you declare dependencies without version; versions come from the parent POM.

Plugin configs are not managed by the BOM, so annotationProcessorPaths (lombok) entries need explicit versions.

Without a specified Lombok version in the compiler plugin, Maven skips Lombok‚Äôs annotation processor and does not generate the log field.

## Loggers vs Appenders
a logger is the interface for sending log messages, 
and an appender defines where those messages are delivered ‚Äî such as a console, file, or remote service.

### üîÅ RollingFileAppender vs FileAppender (Quick Revision)

* **FileAppender**: Writes to a single log file ‚Üí grows indefinitely ‚Üí ‚ùå not production-friendly

* **RollingFileAppender**:

    * ‚úÖ **Performs log file Rotation**: ie Automatically creates a new log file based on size or time
    * ‚úÖ **Size-based rotation** (e.g., after 10MB)
    * ‚úÖ **Time-based rotation** (daily, hourly, etc.)
    * ‚úÖ **Retention**: `maxHistory` (e.g., keep 7 days)
    * ‚úÖ **Storage cap**: `totalSizeCap` (e.g., 1GB)
    * üìÅ Archives logs as `app-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

‚û°Ô∏è Always prefer `RollingFileAppender` in production for clean, manageable logs.

üßµ What is an AsyncAppender?
The AsyncAppender is a non-blocking logging appender that buffers log events in a separate thread before passing them to the actual appender (like a FileAppender or RollingFileAppender).
it holds a reference to the actual appender ( file, console etc) and forwards log events to it asynchronously.


# HTTP Status Codes
### 400 means request is reaching your controller, but JSON ‚ÜîÔ∏è Java conversion failed.
### 500 means something went wrong in your code, like a NullPointerException or an unhandled exception.
### 404 means the requested resource was not found, like a missing endpoint or incorrect URL.
### 200 means everything is fine, and the request was successful.


# Bean 
We use a @Bean method when we want to override or customize an auto-configured bean provided by Spring Boot or a framework. It lets us take control over how that bean is created."

Spring Boot auto-configures many beans (like SecurityFilterChain, PasswordEncoder, ObjectMapper, RestTemplate, etc.) based on defaults.

But if you define a @Bean of the same type, Spring uses your version instead of the default.

This is called **bean overriding or customizing auto-configuration.**

#@Autowired 
is used to inject a bean (auto-configured or user-defined) at the point of use ‚Äî whether into a constructor, field, or method.


#Ways to create Beans.
1. Stereotype Annotations: @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller
   - Automatically scanned and registered by Spring.
2. @Bean Methods: 
   - Explicitly define beans in a @Configuration class.
   - Useful for customizing or overriding auto-configured beans.
3. Auto-configuration:
   - Spring Boot automatically configures beans based on classpath dependencies and properties.
   - These can be injected using @Autowired.

## When to use @Autowired?
@Autowired is optional only for constructor injection when there's exactly one constructor. 
In all other cases ‚Äî like field or setter injection ‚Äî @Autowired is required.‚Äù

## Dependency Graph
Dependency Graph is a directed graph showing how beans depend on each other.
It enables spring to :
1. Decide order of bean creation
2. Manage their lifecycle and scopes
2. Inject dependencies correctly
3. Avoid circular dependencies
